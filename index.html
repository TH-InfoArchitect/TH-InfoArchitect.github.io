                    <h2>Cats in shelters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every year, 3.2 million cats enter animals shelters across the US.  Of those, 1.6 million are adopted by new owners, 90,000 are returned to their original owners after going missing, and, unfortunately, 860,000 are euthanized.  Many loving feline companions are sent to their death, despite an eligible owner being out there.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why pick a cat as a pet?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because they're good.
